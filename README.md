# Wcat_Commands
Created command similar to  cat command used in bash for windows cmd.

syntax 
wcat [options] [files]

Currently these are working and all commands are made global using npm init
1- wcat filename => displays content of the file in the terminal 
3- wcat -s filename => convert big line breaks into a singular file 
4- wcat -n filename => give numbering to all the lines 
5- wcat -b filename => give numbering to non-empty lines
